# Chrome Extension Development Request  

## **Key Features**  
1. A small pixelated cat appears on the corners of the browser or the active webpage.  
2. The cat plays different animations based on user interactions with the webpage:  
   - **Scrolling:** The cat appears to be "thinking."  
   - **Idle:** The cat falls asleep.  
3. A toggle button in the Chrome toolbar allows the user to enable or disable the cat.  
4. When the user **single-clicks** the cat, it plays a short animation, such as:  
   - Waving and saying "Hi."  
   - Displaying the current **IP address, weather, or location** (if permissions allow).  
5. The cat must **not interfere** with normal webpage interactions (e.g., clicking links, typing, scrolling).  

## **Requirements**  
- The code should be well-structured and documented.  
- Follow Chrome Extension best practices for performance and security. 
- If possible, provided the pixelated cat images or other assets.
